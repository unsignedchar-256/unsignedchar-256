## Welcome! :octocat:
I have nothing. But, **welcome** for everyone who came to my profile!

## "Who are you?"
A small kid in 2nd grade in senior high school (known as "Sekolah Menengah Atas" or SMA here). I'm a big Android enthusiast. So I develop **garbage useless shits** (literal fact) Android shits.

### Why `unsigned char`?
I don't have any idea of this account name. Do not ask for this shit!

### More details about me
Actually I have some projects, but none of them are useful. So, I do not have any plan to share them.

I love to exploring GitHub repositories for searching some references, exploring useful APIs and libraries, and sometimes just for exploring some interesting repositories. I will give them a star and save them just in case I need them.

Here are some things that I use everyday:

### Random Facts
- 🇰🇷 I stan [TWICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twice) so much <3, they're the best group ever exist in this world (literal GOAT)
- 👨🏻‍💻 I code everyday but no result (ts pmo sm 💔)
- 🤖 Vibe coderrrr!!!    
- 💀 I scroll too much TikTok videos everyday, that's why my brain has been rotten so much
- 🖥️ I open at least one VM session everyday (I love VirtualBox so much)
- 💻 I'm 10 times more addicted with my laptop than my phone (I use my phone only for scrolling), which means at least one `login` session everyday
- 🐧 I'm building a tiny Linux distribution but no plan to publish it, not even ready (spoiler: it has kernel 6.14)
- 👾 I don't play games but code (it's all about skill issue shits, but lowkey I play Minecraft Java)
- 👥 I'm ENTP-T/INTP-T (with ~80% of Thinking and ~90% of Turbulence)

> y'all must've listened to TWICE songs at least once in your life

### My future plan
I don't know I will do that or not. No one knows (not even myself lmao)!

1. Public repositories
   > I will make a public repository if I have something useful to share, but they're tons of shits.

### What are you doing right now?
Currently falling in love with Android, 24/7 for Android. ~~Finally, started to make contributions after thousand years!!~~ **inactive**

### Translations
1. **🇮🇩 Indonesian (native)**
2. 🇰🇷 Korean
   > I'm not a native Korean. I only translate strings that I understand (partial translation).
