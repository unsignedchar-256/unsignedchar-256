## Welcome! :octocat:
I have nothing. But, **welcome** for everyone who came to my profile!

## "Who are you?"
A small kid in 1st grade in SHS (senior high school, commonly known as "Sekolah Menengah Atas" or SMA here). I'm a big Android enthusiast. So I develop **garbage useless** (sorry, that's a fact) Android applications.

### Why `unsigned char`?
I don't have any idea of this account name. Do not ask

### More details about me
Actually I have some projects, but none of them are useful. So, I do not have any plan to share them.

I love to exploring GitHub repositories for searching some references, exploring useful APIs and libraries, and sometimes just for exploring some interesting repositories. I will give them a star and save them just in case I need them.

Here are some things that I use everyday:
|      Thing       |                      Description                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Operating System | GNU/Linux Ubuntu 24.10 (KDE)                                       |
|     Kernel       | 6.11.0                                                             |
|       IDE        | Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA Community                            |
|   Code Editor    | Microsoft Visual Studio Code Preview                               |
|    Languages     | Kotlin                                                             |

> Still using Windows 11 Insider, but I primarily use Linux.

### My future plan
I don't know I will do that or not. No one knows!

1. Public repositories
   > I will make a public repository if I have something useful to share, but they're a plenty of garbages.

### What are you doing right now?
Currently falling in love with Android, 24/7 for Android. ~~Finally, started to make contributions after thousand years!!~~ **inactive**

### Translations
1. **🇮🇩 Indonesian (native)**  
2. 🇰🇷 Korean
   > I'm not a native Korean. I only translate strings that I understand (partial translation).

That's it, yall! Thanks for coming~
