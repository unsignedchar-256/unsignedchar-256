### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
-->

### Welcome! :octocat:
I have nothing. No contributions and any repositories. But, **welcome** for everyone who came to my profile!

### Details about me
Actually I have a lot of projects, but none of them are useful. So, I do not have any plan to share them. Also, my programming skills are ðŸ’©.

I love to exploring GitHub repositories for searching some references, exploring useful APIs and libraries, and sometimes just for exploring some interesting repositories. I will give them a star and save them just in case I need them.

Here are some things that I use everyday:
|      Thing       |                      Description                    |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Operating System | Windows 11 Pro (Insider Preview Dev)								 |
|       IDE        | Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 Preview      |
|   Code Editor    | Microsoft Visual Studio Code Preview                |
|    Languages     | C# (.NET) and C++ (using Microsoft Visual C++)      |

### My future plan
  - Public repositories
    > I will make a public repository if I have something useful to share. But I guess they will be a garbage, full of bugs, and full of security vulnerabilities.

### What are you doing right now?
Currently, I am learning C++. As a person who just started to learn C++, I don't know a lot of C++. If I made a commit on your project, I am so sorry if I messed up your C/C++ project.

I love templates! So, please do not remove everything below. Thank you! :D
