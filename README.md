### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
-->

### Welcome! :octocat:
I have nothing. No contributions and any repositories. But, **welcome** for everyone who came to my profile!

### Details about me
Actually I have a lot of projects, but none of them are useful. So, I do not have any plan to share them. Also, my programming skills are ðŸ’©.

Here are some things that I use everyday:
|      Thing       |                      Description                    |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Operating System | Windows 11 Pro (Insider Preview Dev)								 |
|       IDE        | Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 Preview      |
|   Code Editor    | Microsoft Visual Studio Code Preview                |
|    Languages     | C# (.NET) and C++ (using Microsoft Visual C++)      |

### My future plan
I will ll make a public repository if I have something useful to share.
