### Hi there 👋
-->

## Welcome! :octocat:
I have nothing. But, **welcome** for everyone who came to my profile!

### Why `unsigned char`?
~~Why you're asking?~~ I didn't know what name to use for this account, and `unsigned char` appeared in my mind that time. It's my favorite data type in C/C++! Useful when you only want to use less memory because `unsigned char` takes only 1 byte.

### Details about me
Actually I have some projects, but none of them are useful. So, I do not have any plan to share them.

I love to exploring GitHub repositories for searching some references, exploring useful APIs and libraries, and sometimes just for exploring some interesting repositories. I will give them a star and save them just in case I need them.

Here are some things that I use everyday:
|      Thing       |                      Description                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Operating System | Windows 11 Enterprise (Insider Preview Dev)                        |
|     OS Build     | [Latest WIP Dev Build](https://aka.ms/DevLatest)                   |
|       IDE        | Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 Preview, Android Studio     |
|   Code Editor    | Microsoft Visual Studio Code Preview                               |
|    Languages     | C# (.NET) and C++ (using Microsoft Visual C++), Kotlin             |

### My future plan
I don't know I will do that or not. No one knows!

1. Public repositories
   > I will make a public repository if I have something useful to share, but they're garbages.

### What are you doing right now?
I'm interested with Android lately. Finally, I'm just started to make contributions after thousand years!!

### Translations
1. **🇮🇩 Indonesian (native)**  
2. 🇰🇷 Korean
   > I'm not a native Korean. I only translate strings that I understand.

That's it! Thanks for coming.
